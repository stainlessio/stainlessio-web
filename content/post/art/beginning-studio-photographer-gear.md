Recently, my sister asked me for a list of gear that would be a good beginning studio photographer setup for yearbook pictures.  Since I was putting together a list of her, I thought it would be good to make it a public list, in case other people are interested.

I'm going to color code the list below with the following colors having the following meanings: <span class="essential">essential</span>,
and <span class="nice">Nice to have</span>.  Afterwards, I'll talk about a possible upgrade, if your budget allows.

*   $99.96 <span class="essential">Adorama Studio Lighting Kit (3 light)</span> - This is a constant light setup, and is the cheapest way to go, though you do need a camera with good high ISO noise response.
*   $87.49 <span class="nice">Interfit Flat Panel Reversible Black/White reflector 35x70" with stand</span> - Alternately, you can just use a large piece of white foam core for the reflector.
*   $300 <span class="essential">A Sturdy Tripod</span> - I'm a fan of manfrotto, and I would look for one with at least 6ft in height, prices vary widely here, so shop around.
*   $339 <span class="nice">Sekonic LITEMASTER Pro L-478D</span> - a light meter is nice to have, though not essential with digital cameras
*   $200 <span class="essential">Lightroom</span> - For yearbook pictures, you need a bulk-image workflow program, and lightroom is hard to beat.

Notice that I do not include a background.  I would suggest finding an empty wall to use for the yearbook shots because, in a school, that will be easiest.

### Upgrade to entry level studio strobes

*   $674.85 <span class="essential">3x Alienbees B400</span> two for the background, one of main light
*   $285.98 <span class="essential">2x Interfit C-Stands with boom</span> to hold the background lights
*   $113.79 <span class="essential">1x Iterfit C-Stand</span>
