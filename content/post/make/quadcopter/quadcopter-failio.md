Delayed update because I've been having a bitch of a time getting
my quadcopter to work properly.  First, the documentation on how things
were supposed to be wired up was just plain wrong, but once I get that
straightened out, I still couldn't really get it off the ground.

Come to find out, and I hope I didn't ruin my battery, but the motors
are underpowered for the weight.

Weighing the quadcopter, it is about 1.5kg, which is just a bit too much
for the motors to handle.  At full throttle, it barely gets off the ground.

Also, grass is a horrible substance to take off from as is evident in
the video below.
