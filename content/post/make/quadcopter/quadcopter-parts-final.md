### IMPORTANT UPDATE!

I forgot to order one part! DOH! So my kit is not complete when these orders come in.  You *need* a programming cable for the transmitter.  Otherwise, you can't change the settings.  This is the one you need.

### The Final Parts

The last pieces needed to put the quad together have been ordered.

### Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)

You need four of these bad boys, and I decided to be lazy and order a 4-in-1 ESC that has 4x20A ESCs with BEC (battery
elimination cutoff? basically it cuts off the battery so it doesn't drain too low)  The one I picked is the
[Q-Brain](http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=42842), which looks like the picture below:

### The Rest

The only other things you need are an ESC programming card to configure the ESCs.  Since the Q-Brain is compatible with
the [Turnigy Programming Card](http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=33282), That's what I bought.

And lastly the charger, which any will do, as long as it's a balanced charger.  Since I'm going 3S batteries,
I chose
[the Turnigy one for 2S and 3S batteries](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24289&aff=1110095)
It's simple and cheap, but takes forever to charge the battery.  Go with a better one if you can.
