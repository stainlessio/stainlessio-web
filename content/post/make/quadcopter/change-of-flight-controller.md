summary: Changing the flight controller to a KK2.0
---

My MultiWii board was missing pins and has zero documentation, so I decided to return it and get the
[KK2.0](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=24723&aff=1110095)
because it's well documented, well supported, and has some good features.

It's lacking the automatic gimbal control for cameras, but whatever.  The price was roughly the same.
